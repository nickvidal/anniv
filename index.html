        <p>
          This year (2023) we will be celebrating several important milestones,
          including the <b>25th Anniversary of Open Source</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Celebrating Anniversaries is much more than just throwing a party. It
          is also an opportunity to look back in history, to reevaluate the
          mission and values, and to build a new future for an organization or
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, Open Anniversary aims to provide an innovative and
          inclusive platform for the community to celebrate, remember, and
          reimagine the open source movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The celebrations will revolve around 12 themes, one for each month of
          the year. A major milestone was selected for each theme. The themes are presented below:

            <p>
              On January 15, 2001, Wikipedia was established. Creative Commons
              was coincidentally established on the same date. Wikipedia was
              created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, while Creative Commons
              was founded by Lawrence Lessig, Hal Abelson, and Eric Eldred. Both
              Creative Commons and Wikipedia are highlights from the free
              culture movement.

            <time class="date">February</time>
            <p>
              The "open source" label was created by Christine Peterson at a
              strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto,
              California. That same month, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) was
              founded by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond as a general educational
              and advocacy organization. The group adopted the Open Source
              Definition for open-source software, based on the Debian Free
              Software Guidelines.

              The book "The Open Organization" published by Jim Whitehurst,
              former CEO at Red Hat and current president at IBM, provides great
              insights on how to build a successful business based on many open
              source principles, including transparency, participation, and
              community. Red Had celebrates its anniversary in March--Bob Young
              founded ACC Corporation in March 1993 and the company was later
              renamed to Red Hat Software when merged with Marc Ewing's
              business.

              open government, was founded in April 2006 by Ellen S. Miller and
              Michael R. Klein. Open government is the governing doctrine which
              holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and
              proceedings of the government to allow for effective public
              oversight.

              working on the Open Hardware Summit. The OSHWA is a non-profit

              Open Educational Resources (OER), one of the key components of
              Open Education, was first coined in July 2002 at UNESCO's Forum on
              Open Courseware. OER are teaching, learning and research materials
              in any medium – digital or otherwise – that reside in the public
              domain or have been released under an open license that permits
              no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with
              no or limited restrictions.

              Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to develop a distributed
              information system in March 1989, while working at CERN (European
              Organization for Nuclear Research). On August 6, 1991, he
              published the first website, dedicated to the World Wide Web
              project itself, and announced it on the Internet. In 1993, the
              World Wide Web project was made available with an open license,
              allowing the Open Web to flourish.

              On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds, then a 21-year-old university
              student from Finland, announced a project on the comp.os.minix
              user group. The initial release (version 0.0.1) was created on
              September 17, 1991, and the official public release happened on
              October 5, 1991. In January 1992, Linux adopted the GNU GPLv2
              license. This "hobby project" would later become one of the most
              prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration.

              software movement, which promotes the universal freedom to study,
              distribute, create, and modify computer software. The GNU General

              Aaron Swartz was born November 8, 1986 and was one of the leading
              voices for open access. He published the "Guerilla Open Access
              Manifesto," helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign
              Committee, and founded the online group Demand Progress, known for
              its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act. His death was the
              result of years of disproportional prosecution from the
              government.

              On December 7, 2007, a meeting held in Sebastopol, California, was
