              Programmer Ward Cunningham&nbsp;launches WikiWikiWeb on 25 March
              1995. In&nbsp;Hawaiian, "wiki" means&nbsp;"quick". Cunningham's
              idea was to make WikiWikiWeb's pages quickly editable by its
              users.

              On July 14, 1998, the Open Content Project published the Open
              Content License, which was among the first public copyright
              licenses intended for content (i.e. documents) rather than for
              software.
            </p>

            <p>
              The following year, on June 8, 1999, it published the Open
              Publication License, which was intended to be an improvement upon
              the Open Content License.&nbsp;The two licenses differ
              substantially: the Open Publication License is not a share-alike
              license while the Open Content License is; and the Open
              Publication License can optionally restrict the distribution of
              derivative works or restrict the commercial distribution of paper
              copies of the work or derivatives of the work, whereas the Open
              Content License forbids copying for profit altogether. The authors
              were&nbsp;Eric S. Raymond, David A. Wiley, and Tim O'Reilly.

            In 1998, the United States Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright
            Term Extension Act, which extended copyright protections for twenty
            additional years, resulting in a total guaranteed copyright term of
            seventy years after a creator's death. The bill was heavily lobbied
            by music and film corporations like Disney, and dubbed as the Mickey
            Mouse Protection Act.

              Internet publisher Eric Eldred, represented by Lawrence Lessig and
              a team at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, challenged
              the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act initially in 1999

              On January 15, 2003 the Supreme Court announced its decision in a
              7-2 ruling: the act was held to be constitutional, thus preventing
              a number of works from entering the public domain in 1998 and
              following years.

              The GNU Free Documentation License (GNU FDL or simply GFDL) is a

              designed for manuals, textbooks, other reference and instructional
              materials, and documentation which often accompanies GNU software.
              However, it can be used for any text-based work, regardless of
              subject matter.&nbsp;The GFDL was released in draft form for
              feedback in September 1999. After revisions, version 1.1 was
              issued in March 2000.

              In March 9, 2000, the Nupedia project was started. Its intention
              was to publish articles written by experts which would be licensed
              as free content. Nupedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, with Larry
              Sanger as editor-in-chief, and funded by the web-advertising
              company Bomis. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making
              a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with
              the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.

              In January 2001, Wikipedia began as a side-project of Nupedia, to
              allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer-review
              process. The name was suggested by Sanger on 11 January 2001 as a
              portmanteau of the words wiki (Hawaiian for "quick") and
              encyclopedia. The wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org domain names
              were registered on 12 and 13 January,&nbsp;respectively, with
              wikipedia.org being brought online on the same day.&nbsp;The
              project formally opened on 15 January ("Wikipedia Day"), with the
              first international Wikipedias – the French, German, Catalan,
              Swedish, and Italian editions – being created between March and
              May.

              In January 15 2001, Lawrence Lessig initiated Creative Commons by

            <p>
              Lessig focuses on a fair balance between the interest of the
              public to use and participate into released creative works and the
              need of protection for a creator's work, which still enables a
              "read-write" remix culture.

              Creative Commons was first presented to the public in a press
              release on 16 May, 2002. "The Creative Commons will provide a free
              set of tools to enable creators to share aspects of their
              copyrighted works with the public," it read, adding: "We stand on
              the shoulders of giants by revisiting, reusing, and transforming
              the ideas and works of our peers and predecessors."

              Wikitravel is a collaborative travel guide started in July 2003 by
              Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins, partly inspired by
              Wikipedia.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2006, Internet Brands bought the trademark and servers and
              later introduced advertising to the website. This move met
              opposition from users, with many German and Italian editors
              leaving in December 2006 for a newly established wiki, Wikivoyage.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2012, in response to sustained dissatisfaction with Internet
              Brands' commercialization and technical support, a large portion
              of the editing community, including the founders, left and
              transferred their contributions to the Wikivoyage travel guide,
              which was relaunched as a Wikimedia Foundation–hosted project in
              January 2013.

              Wikisource is an online digital library of free-content textual
              sources. Originally conceived as an archive to store useful or
              important historical texts (its first text was the Déclaration
              universelle des Droits de l'Homme), it has expanded to become a
              general-content library. The project officially began on November
              24, 2003 under the name Project Sourceberg, a play on the famous
              Project Gutenberg. The name Wikisource was adopted later that
              year.

              Wikimedia Commons is an online repository of free-use images,
              sounds, and other media. The project was proposed by Erik Möller
              in March 2004 and launched on September 7, 2004. A key motivation
              behind the setup of a central repository was the desire to reduce
              duplication of effort across the Wikimedia projects and languages,
              as the same file had to be uploaded to many different wikis
              separately before Commons was created. Files from Wikimedia
              Commons can be used across all Wikimedia projects in all
              languages, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikivoyage,
              Wikispecies, Wikisource, and Wikinews.

              Wikispecies was created to serve as a comprehensive free content

              Mandl, the project had grown a framework encompassing the Linnaean
              taxonomy with links to Wikipedia articles on individual species by
              April 2005.

              the provision of learning activities. Wikiversity is one of many
              wikis used in educational contexts, as well as many initiatives
              that are creating free and open educational resources.

              DBpedia was created with the goal to extract structured content
              from the information created in the Wikipedia project. DBpedia
              allows users to semantically query relationships and properties of
              Wikipedia resources, including links to other related datasets.
              DBpedia was initiated in 2007 by Sören Auer, Christian Bizer,
              Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak and Zachary Ives.
              Tim Berners-Lee described DBpedia as one of the most famous parts
              of the decentralized Linked Data effort.

              On February 2007, Creative Commons releases version 3.0 of its
              licenses.&nbsp;It focused on internationalizing the “generic”
              license and international harmonization of the licenses.
              Additionally, it expanded to encompass Creative Commons' long-held
              vision&nbsp;of establishing a compatibility structure to allow
              interoperability between different flexible content copyright
              licenses.

              a long period of discussion and negotiation between and
              among&nbsp;the Free Software Foundation, Creative Commons, the
              Wikimedia Foundation and others had produced a proposal to modify
              the Free Documentation License in such a fashion as to allow the
              possibility for the Wikimedia Foundation to migrate the projects
              to the similar Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (CC BY-SA)

              Wikidata is a collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph.
              The creation of the project was funded by donations from the Allen
              Institute for Artificial Intelligence, the Gordon and Betty Moore
              Foundation, and Google, Inc. The development of the project is
              mainly driven by Wikimedia Deutschland under the management of
              Lydia Pintscher. On 7 September 2015, the Wikimedia Foundation
              announced the release of the Wikidata Query Service, which lets
              users run queries on the data contained in Wikidata. The service
              uses SPARQL as the query language.

              In November 2014, Creative Commons releases version 4.0 of its
              licenses. The new licenses have improved terminology that’s better
              understood internationally, making them ready-to-use around the
              world,&nbsp;without porting.
