              The Arduino project began in 2005 as a tool for students at the
              Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in&nbsp;Italy.&nbsp;In 2003,
              Hernando Barragán created the development platform Wiring as a
              Master's thesis project at IDII, under the supervision of Massimo
              Banzi and Casey Reas. The project goal was to create simple, low
              cost tools for creating digital projects by non-engineers. In
              2005, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis, another IDII student, and
              David Cuartielles, extended Wiring by adding support for the
              cheaper ATmega8 microcontroller. The new project was called
              Arduino.

              RepRap was founded in 2005 by Dr Adrian Bowyer from the University
              of Bath in England. The goal was to develop a low-cost 3D printer
              that can print most of its own components, but it is now made up
              of hundreds of collaborators worldwide. RepRap is short for
              replicating rapid prototyper.&nbsp;As an open design, all of the
              designs produced by the project are released under a free software
              license, the GNU General Public License.

              The BeagleBoard is a low-power open-source single-board computer
              produced by Texas Instruments in association with Digi-Key and
              Newark element14. The board was developed by a small team of
              engineers as an educational board that could be used in colleges
              around the world to teach open source hardware and software
              capabilities. It is also sold to the public under the Creative
              Commons share-alike license.

              Eben Upton, Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft from the
              University of Cambridge started developing a tiny and affordable
              computer for their students. In 2008, the team started a
              collaboration with Pete Lomas and David Braben and formed the
              Raspberry Pi Foundation the subsequent year. Three years later,
              the Raspberry Pi Model B was born, selling over two million units
              within two years of mass production.

              RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA)
              based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC)
              principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is
              provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to
              use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V
              hardware, open source operating systems with RISC-V support are
              available and the instruction set is supported in several popular
              software toolchains.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project began in 2010 by Krste Asanović and David
              Patterson&nbsp;at the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;The
              RISC-V Foundation was founded in 2015 to build an open,
              collaborative community of software and hardware innovators based
              on the RISC-V ISA.

              The Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) was established as an
              organization in June 2012 by engineer Alicia Gibb, who had been
              working on the Open Hardware Summit. The OSHWA is a non-profit
              organization that advocates for open-source hardware.
