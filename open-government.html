              directive starting this initiative was issued on January 20, 2009.
              President Obama’s Open Government Directive (December 8, 2009)
              presented a definition of “open government”: the three principles
              of transparency, participation, and collaboration form the
              cornerstone of an open government.

              Code for America was founded in 2009 to address the widening gap
              between the public and private sectors in their effective use of
              technology and design. The organization began by enlisting
              technology and design professionals to work with city governments
              in the United States in order to build open-source applications
              and promote openness, participation, and efficiency in government,
              and now works with state, county, and federal government to spread
              the principles and practices of "delivery-driven government." It
              has grown into a cross-sector network of public sector change
              agents and a platform for "civic hacking".

              The Open Government Partnership (OGP) was formally launched on
              September 20, 2011 on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly
              meeting during which Heads of State from 8 founding governments
              (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Philippines, South Africa,
              United Kingdom, and the United States) endorsed the Open
              Government Declaration and announced their country action plans
              along with an equal number of civil society leaders.&nbsp;The
              eight founding members also welcomed the commitment of 38
              governments to join OGP.&nbsp;Since its creation, OGP has resulted
              in over 2,500 commitments made by 79 participating countries,
              covering a third of the world's population.

              In May 2013 Barack Obama issued an executive order which
              established the Open Data Policy along with a memorandum from the
              Office of Management and Budget which supported that policy. These
              policies were developed as a way to promote economic growth and
              create jobs. An executive order, “Making Open and Machine-Readable
              the New Default for Government Information,” and another memo,
              “Open Data Policy: Managing Information as an Asset,” supported
              his call to create a more participatory, collaborative and
              transparent government. The White House’s Project Open Data grew
              out of these memos. It’s a collection of code, tools and case
              studies to help agencies adopt open data programs and share
              resources and information on open data.

              The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act)
              is a law that aims to make information on federal expenditures
              more easily accessible and transparent.&nbsp;The law requires the
              U.S. Department of the Treasury to establish common standards for
              financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand
              the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government
              website, USASpending.&nbsp;The goal of the law is to improve the
              ability of Americans to track and understand how the government is
              spending their tax dollars.

              The European Data Portal is an initiative of the European
              Commission launched on November 16, 2015. The<span
                >&nbsp;Portal was created to gather Public Sector Information of
                the 28 European Member States and the four EFTA countries (these
                countries are also referred to as the EU28+).</span
              >&nbsp;The EU28+ countries publish public data on national data
              portals and geospatial portals. In order to provide one single
              access point to all of this data, the European Data Portal was
              created.
