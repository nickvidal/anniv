              arXiv is an open-access repository of electronic preprints. In
              August 1991, Paul Ginsparg created a central repository mailbox
              stored at the Los Alamos National Laboratory which could be
              accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon
              added: FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and the World Wide Web in
              1993. The arXiv repository consists of scientific papers in the
              fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, electrical engineering,
              computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, mathematical
              finance and economics.

                          intended to circumvent measures that control access to

              2002.&nbsp;It arose from a conference convened in Budapest by the

              access – at the time also known as Free Online Scholarship.

              scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure
              their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow
              anyone to access it".
