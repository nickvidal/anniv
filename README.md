Open Anniversary

This year (2023) marks the 25th Anniversary of Open Source. This is a huge milestone for the whole community to celebrate!

Celebrating Anniversaries is much more than just throwing a party. It is also an opportunity to look back in history, to reevaluate the mission and values, and to build a new future for an organization or community.

With that in mind, Open Anniversary aims to provide an innovative and inclusive platform for the community to celebrate, remember, and reimagine the open source movement.
