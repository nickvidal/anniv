              Eric S. Raymond published "The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings
              on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,"
              initially as an essay at the Linux Kongress on May 27, 1997 in
              Würzburg (Germany), and later as a book on September 30, 1999. It
              described key differences between traditional development models
              and the decentralized model typical of open source, based on his
              observations of the Linux kernel development process and his
              experiences managing an open source project, fetchmail.

              In January 1998, Netscape Communications Corporation released the
              code for Netscape Communicator as open source, influenced by the
              Eric S. Raymond's essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," in the
              hopes that it would become a popular open- source project.
              Netscape placed the code under the Netscape Public License, which
              was similar to the GNU General Public License, and started the
              Mozilla project to coordinate its development.

              The "open source" label was created by Christine Peterson at a
              strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto,
              California, shortly after the announcement of the release of the
              Netscape source code. This group looked for a way to re-brand the
              free software movement to emphasize the business potential of the
              sharing of source code.&nbsp;Two of those present at the Palo Alto
              meeting (Eric Raymond and Michael Tiemann) would later serve as
              presidents of the&nbsp;OSI, and other attendees (including Todd
              Andersen, Jon “maddog” Hall, Larry Augustin, and Sam Ockman)
              became key early supporters of the organization.

              The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded in late February 1998
              by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens. The OSI hoped that the use of
              the label "open source" would eliminate ambiguity, particularly
              for individuals who perceive "free software" as anti-commercial.
              They sought to bring a higher profile to the practical benefits of
              freely available source code, and they wanted to bring major
              software businesses and other high-tech industries into open
              source. OSI was formed as an educational, advocacy, and
              stewardship nonprofit organization.

              One of the first tasks undertaken by OSI was to draft the Open
              Source Definition (OSD), and use it to begin creating a list of
              OSI-approved licenses.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Open Source Definition was originally derived from the Debian
              Free Software Guidelines (DFSG). Bruce Perens had composed the
              original draft of the DFSG, and it was edited, refined, and
              approved as formal policy by the Debian developer community in
              1997.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Open Source Definition was then created during the launch of
              the OSI in February&nbsp;1998 by revising the DFSG and removing
              Debian-specific references.

              The "open source" term was given a big boost at an event organized
              in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally
              titled the "Freeware Summit" and later named the "Open Source
              Summit", the event brought together the leaders of many of the
              most important free and open-source projects, including Linus
              Torvalds (Linux), Larry Wall (Perl), Brian Behlendorf (Apache),
              Eric Allman (Sendmail), Guido van Rossum (Python), Phil

              As free and open software became more popular, industry incumbents
              such as Microsoft started to see it as a serious threat. This was
              shown in a leaked 1998 document by Eric S. Raymond, confirmed by
              Microsoft as genuine, which came to be called the first of the
              Halloween Documents. These documents acknowledged that free
              software products such as Linux were technologically competitive
              with some of Microsoft's products, and set out a strategy to
              combat them. It revealed that "FUD" (spreading Fear, Uncertainty,
              and Doubt) was a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy,
              acknowledged and understood internally. The document then suggests
              that this can be stopped by "extending these protocols and
              developing new protocols" and "de-commoditizing&nbsp;protocols
              &amp; applications". This policy has been internally nicknamed
              "embrace, extend, extinguish". The document describes, among other
              points, Microsoft's channeling of $86 million&nbsp;to SCO.

              OSI established the "License Discuss" and "License Review" mailing
              lists to discuss open source licenses, update existing licenses,
              and review new licenses submitted for certification.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today these lists still exist, supporting the OSI License Review
              Process, with the goal of ensuring that licenses and software
              labeled as "open source" conforms to existing community norms and
              expectations. For that reason, all licenses submitted to the OSI
              for certification as must go through a public review process. The
              OSI Board consults with entities in advance to help them navigate
              the process and improve their license.

              In November of 1998, the OSI held a contest for&nbsp;"a logo which
              can be used to promote the concept of Open Source, and to indicate
              support of the Open Source movement." By June of 1999, the OSI
              selected the now iconic "Keyhole Logo" by Colin Viebrock.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the community also needed a reliable way of knowing
              whether a piece of software really is open source, the OSI
              registered a certification mark, "OSI Certified." When this mark
              is included with software, users can be assured the software
              carries a license that conforms to the Open Source Definition.

              The OSI tackles license proliferation to help developers choose an
              appropriate license for their project and make it easier for them
              to understand what they are agreeing to in a multi-license
              distribution. The OSI recommends licenses that are popular and
              widely used or with strong communities. Examples of popular
              licences include Apache, BSD, GPL, and MIT.

              In 2018, while the OSI was on its 20th Anniversary World Tour,
              some faux open source licenses started emerging, most
              notably&nbsp;the Commons Clause and the Server Side Public
              License. OSI and its partners, with the support from the open
              source community, were able to successfully organize&nbsp;over 100
              activities across 40 events worldwide to celebrate&nbsp;its
              anniversary&nbsp;and defend the open source definition. At the end
              of the tour, several OSI affiliates signed the Affirmation of the
              Open Source Definition.
