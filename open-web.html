              Berners-Lee was encouraged by his boss, Mike Sendall, to begin
              implementing his system on a newly acquired NeXT workstation. He
              formalized the proposal together with his colleague Robert
              Cailliau and by Christmas 1990, he&nbsp;had built all the tools
              necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol
              (HTTP), the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web
              browser (named WorldWideWeb, which was also a Web editor), the
              first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first
              web server (http://info.cern.ch), and the first Web pages that
              described the project itself.<br />

              visited CERN in September 1991, and was captivated by the Web. He
              brought the NeXT software back to SLAC, where librarian Louise
              Addis adapted it for the VM/CMS operating system on the IBM
              mainframe as a way to display SLAC's catalog of online documents;
              this was the first Web server outside of Europe and the first in
              North America.

              In January 1994, Yahoo! was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo,
              then students at Stanford University. Yahoo! Directory, launched
              in January 1994, became the first popular Web directory. Yahoo!
              Search, later launched in 1995, became the first popular search
              engine on the World Wide Web.

              Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded what would become Netscape
              Communications Corporation and launched their first browser on
              September 9, 1994. Originally it was called Mosaic Netscape, but
              it was renamed as Netscape Navigator to avoid trademark problems
              with NCSA. The internal codename for the browser was Mozilla,
              which stood for "Mosaic killer" and indeed it rapidly became the
              most popular browser.

              The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international
              standards organization for the World Wide Web. It was founded in
              1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization
              for Nuclear Research (CERN). The consortium was founded at the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer
              Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission, the
              Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had
              pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet.

              Marc Andreessen imagined a more dynamic Web and believed that a
              language easy to use by Web designers was needed. He recruited
              Brendan Eich, who in 10 days wrote a prototype for the Netscape
              browser in May 1995. The language was first called Moca, later
              LiveScript, and finally renamed JavaScript (to serve as a
              companion language to Java). The official public announcement of
              JavaScript was on December 4, 1995.

              hopes that it would become a popular open- source project.
              Netscape placed the code under the Netscape Public License, which
              was similar to the GNU General Public License, and started the
              Mozilla project to coordinate its development.

              RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication)&nbsp;is a web
              feed&nbsp;that allows users and applications to access updates to
              websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds
              can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different
              websites in a single news aggregator.
            </p>

            <p>
              RDF Site Summary, the first version of RSS, was created by Dan
              Libby and Ramanathan V. Guha at Netscape. It was released in March
              1999 for use on the My.Netscape.Com portal.&nbsp;This version
              became known as RSS 0.9.&nbsp;In July 1999, Dan Libby of Netscape
              produced a new version, RSS 0.91,&nbsp;which simplified the format
              by removing RDF elements and incorporating elements from Dave
              Winer's news syndication format.&nbsp;Libby also renamed the
              format from RDF to RSS Rich Site Summary.

              The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web to make
              Internet data machine-readable. To enable the encoding of
              semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description
              Framework (RDF)&nbsp;and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are
              used.&nbsp;Tim Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the
              Semantic Web in 1999 as follows:
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of
              analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and
              transactions between people and computers. A "Semantic Web", which
              makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the
              day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives
              will be handled by machines talking to machines. The "intelligent
              agents" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.

              In January 2001, Wikipedia began as a side-project of Nupedia, to
              allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer-review
              process. The name was suggested by Sanger on 11 January 2001 as a
              portmanteau of the words wiki (Hawaiian for "quick") and
              encyclopedia. The wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org domain names
              were registered on 12 and 13 January,&nbsp;respectively, with
              wikipedia.org being brought online on the same day.&nbsp;The
              project formally opened on 15 January ("Wikipedia Day"), with the
              first international Wikipedias – the French, German, Catalan,
              Swedish, and Italian editions – being created between March and
              May.

              Firefox began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by
              Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross in 2002. To combat what
              they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a
              stand-alone browser, first named Phoenix, later Firebird, and
              finally Firefox. Firefox version 1.0 was released on November 9,
              2004. Firefox's speed, usability, and marketing helped it gain
              market share against Internet Explorer. Within five years of
              launching, Firefox accounted for nearly a third of all web
              browsing.

              Google released the Chrome browser on December 11, 2008, using the
              same WebKit rendering engine as Safari and a faster JavaScript
              engine called V8. Shortly after, an open-sourced version for the
              Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms was released under the name
              Chromium. With a rapid release cycle and a focus on speed, Google
              Chrome eventually overtook all other browsers.

              Node.js was initially developed by Ryan Dahl in March 2009 based
              on Google's open source V8 JavaScript engine. It paved way to the
              use of JavaScript on Web servers. Node.js functions are
              non-blocking, allowing the server to handle a high load of
              concurrent connections. It represents a 'JavaScript everywhere'
              paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single
              programming language.
