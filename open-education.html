              Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a collection
              of standards and specifications for web-based e-learning. It
              defines communications between client side content and a host
              system (called "the run-time environment"), which is commonly
              supported by a learning management system. SCORM also defines how
              content may be packaged into a transferable ZIP file called
              "Package Interchange Format."&nbsp;SCORM is a specification of the
              Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative from the Office of
              the United States Secretary of Defense.

              The UNESCO 2012 Paris OER Declaration, otherwise known as the
              Paris declaration on Open Educational Resources, is a declaration
              urging governments to promote the use of open educational
              resources (OERs) and calling for publicly funded educational
              materials to be released in a freely reusable form.
            </p>

            <p>
              In June 2012, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
              Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the Commonwealth of Learning
              (COL) held a World OER Congress. This took place at the UNESCO
              headquarters in Paris with financial support from the William and
              Flora Hewlett Foundation. At this point, the Open Educational
              Resources (OER) movement was a decade old, the term having been
              coined in another meeting at UNESCO in 2002.
