              Almost all IBM mainframe software was also distributed with source
              code included. User groups were formed to facilitate the exchange
              of software. The SHARE user group was formed in Santa Monica, and
              members exchanged source code on magnetic tape via post. The group
              released the SHARE operating system (SOS) â€” one of the first
              instances of collaborative software development.

              Software was not considered copyrightable before the 1974 US
              Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU)
              decided that "computer programs, to the extent that they embody an
              author's original creation, are proper subject matter of
              copyright".&nbsp;Therefore, software had no licenses attached and
              was shared as public-domain software, typically with source code.
              The CONTU decision plus later court decisions such as Apple v.
              Franklin in 1983 for object code, gave computer programs the
              copyright status of literary works and started the licensing of
              software.

              A&nbsp;general trend began to no longer distribute source code,
              and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled
              from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new
              practice was Richard Stallman, at the time a programmer at the MIT
              Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He was concerned that he could
              no longer study or further modify programs initially written by
              others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong.

              In 1983, Richard Stallman, said he would create a free alternative

              a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix."

              Richard Stallman established a non-profit organization, the Free
              Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the
              project. Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to
              outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of
              free software. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve
              the "free" status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented
              this in the GNU General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow
              authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to
              use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study
              and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but
              requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one
              without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include
              combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are
              prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software,
              and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.

              The GNU General Public License was written by Richard Stallman in
              1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project.
              The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses
              used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985), the GNU Debugger, and
              the GNU C Compiler. These licenses contained similar provisions to
              the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them
              incompatible, despite being the same license. Stallman's goal was
              to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus
              making it possible for many projects to share code.

              GNU Mailman is a computer software application from the GNU
              Project for managing electronic mailing lists. Mailman is coded
              primarily in Python. A very early version of Mailman was written
              by John Viega while a graduate student, who then lost his copy of
              the source in a hard drive crash sometime around 1998. Ken
              Manheimer at CNRI, who was looking for a replacement for
              Majordomo, then took over development. When Manheimer left CNRI,
              Barry Warsaw took over. Mailman 3, the first major new version in
              over a decade, was released in April 2015 and is currently
              maintained by Abhilash Raj.

              In response to legal issues with patents and the DMCA, the Free
              Software Foundation released version 3 of its GNU Public License
              in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA's digital rights
              management (DRM) provisions and patent rights.&nbsp;GPLv3 was
              written by Richard Stallman, with legal counsel from Eben Moglen
              and Richard Fontana from the Software Freedom Law Center.
