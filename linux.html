              Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie create the Unix operating system
              at AT&amp;T's Bell Labs. It's not open source, but they make the
              source code available. Unix was unique because of its portability
              and multitasking capabilities. Since the system’s inception, a
              multitude of different UNIX versions have been collaboratively
              developed — to run workstations, internet servers, and mainframes.

              In 1983, the U.S. Department of Justice settled its second
              antitrust case against AT&amp;T, causing the breakup of the Bell
              System. This relieved AT&amp;T of the 1956 consent decree that had
              prevented the company from commercializing Unix. AT&amp;T promptly
              introduced Unix System V into the market. The newly created
              competition nearly destroyed the long-term viability of Unix,
              because it stifled the free exchanging of source code and led to
              fragmentation and incompatibility.&nbsp;Since the newer commercial
              UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the
              older versions of Unix, the Berkeley researchers continued to
              develop BSD as an alternative to UNIX System III and V.&nbsp;

              In 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was
              released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles
              conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and
              Implementation. While source code for the system was available,
              modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition,
              MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features
              of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for
              personal computers.

              and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things
              people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same

              both as a rescue disk and as an installer for the Debian
              distribution. Since that time, it has been extended to become the
              de facto standard core user space toolset for embedded Linux
              devices and Linux distribution installers.

              Torvalds announced in 1996 that there would be a mascot for Linux,
              a penguin. This was because when they were about to select the
              mascot, Torvalds mentioned he was bitten by a little penguin on a
              visit to the National Zoo &amp; Aquarium in Canberra, Australia.
              Larry Ewing provided the original draft of today's well known
              mascot based on this description. The name Tux was suggested by
              James Hughes as derivative of Torvalds' UniX, along with being
              short for tuxedo, a type of suit with color similar to that of a
              penguin.

              Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate
              project at the University of Hawaii, intended to provide a single
              repository for well-tested third-party software packages so that
              non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use.
              The key difference between Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that
              Fedora's repository development would be collaborative with the
              global volunteer community.&nbsp;Fedora Linux was launched in
              2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued&nbsp;in favor of Red Hat
              Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

              Firefox began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by
              Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross in 2002. To combat what
              they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a
              stand-alone browser, first named Phoenix, later Firebird, and
              finally Firefox. Firefox version 1.0 was released on November 9,
              2004. Firefox's speed, usability, and marketing helped it gain
              market share against Internet Explorer. Within five years of
              launching, Firefox accounted for nearly a third of all web
              browsing.

              Node.js was initially developed by Ryan Dahl in March 2009 based
              on Google's open source V8 JavaScript engine. It paved way to the
              use of JavaScript on Web servers. Node.js functions are
              non-blocking, allowing the server to handle a high load of
              concurrent connections. It represents a 'JavaScript everywhere'
              paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single
              programming language.
